## Compiling and Running

### Compiling

This project has a `Makefile` that can be used to compile all the code. To compile the code, simply run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the executable `bin/pokemon.out` and the `build` folder, which contains all the object files generated during the compilation process.

**Disclaimer**: The `Makefile` uses the `gcc` compiler to compile the code. To use a different compiler, modify the `CC` variable in the `Makefile` to the desired compiler.

### Running

After compiling the code, you can run the executable `bin/pokemon.out` by running the following command:

```bash
./bin/pokemon.out
```

### Cleaning

To clean all the generated files, run the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
